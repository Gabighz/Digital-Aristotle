After implementing stopwords filtering (NLTK dictionary)
Current assigned features: isBold, RAKE
F1 score of 0.066
Notes: 1. The word 'The' is classified as a keyword due to its
       high frequency and high degree of co-occurance.
       We should consider adding 'The' as a stopword.
       Same issue occurs with other words such as 'a', 'th', 'your', etc.

       2. We should convert all strings to lowercase.
       For example, 'Motor' and 'motor' are regarded as different words.

       3. We should filter out all non-alphanumeric characters within a word.
       For example, 'sensors' and 'sensors)' are regarded as different words.

       4. We should filter out all the words in the footers and headers of
       the documents, as they probably contain only irrelevant information,
       such as the name of the lecturer, their email address and the date of the
       lecture, the name of the module etc. (e.g. like in SlidesWeek2).
